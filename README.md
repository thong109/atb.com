# Install the Gulp CLI for the first time of using

You’ll need to install Gulp’s command line interface (CLI) globally. You may need to use `sudo` (for OSX, \*nix, BSD etc) or run your command shell as `Administrator` (for Windows) to do this.

```sh
npm install -g gulp-cli
```

# Install npm dependencies

```sh
npm install
